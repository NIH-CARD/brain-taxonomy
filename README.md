# brain-taxonomy
Tools and artifacts for the generic human brain tissue taxonomy for development of cell type assignment of single nuclei/cells from RNA seq experiments.  

Primarily for use with [CellAssign](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/user_guide/models/cellassign.html)

Currently being leveraged by the [labelator](https://github.com/ergonyc/labelator) and to be used by the ASAP CRN [harmonized-wf-dev](https://github.com/ASAP-CRN/harmonized-wf-dev) tools.
